## My process

Tried to build mobile first which was easy, but I wanted to be precise and use a minimal amount of media queries. So I built the mobile version intially using block, but as i played with the expanding view port 
I noticed some inconsistencies, and I felt more comfortable designing the desktop with flex then working down to the mobile.

## What I learned

I didn't want to use a set color for the button fonts, which I noticed was the same color as the container background. If the background color were to change I wanted the
text color of the button to match it without the extra markup. So I wanted to make the text transparent and shine through the button background to show the container 
looking background.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### Continued development

-Delve deeper into flexbox
-Explore mix blend modes
